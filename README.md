This repository contains the Bayesian Inference for the Analysis of Sub-temporal-resolution Data (BIASD) algorithm and GUI.
It is written in Python and requires scipy, matplotlib, and numpy also.
For optimal capabilities, the integrand that is numerically integrated in BIASD has been written in C. This is also provided here.
